# DMET-501
DMET 501 is an introduction to media engineering course.
And the objecttives of the course are:

1. Write a Program that reads Gray Scale image and writes the values in a text file (Task 1 in Practice Assignment 1).
2. Write a Program that converts a Grayscale image to another image having 8 values only and write this image (Task 2 in Practice Assignment 2).
3. Write a Program that reads a Grayscale image and creates a 1D array Histogram for this image

4- given a butterfly image that is corrupted with “Salt and Pepper” noise. In order to enhance this image you have to apply a kind of a filter to this Image.
A. Apply Mean Filter to the Image:
I. Once with Kernel (3 * 3)
II. Once with Kernel (7 * 7)

B. Apply Median Filter to the Image:
I. Once with Kernel (3 * 3)
II. Once with Kernel (7 * 7)

C. Apply Gaussian Filter to the Image: (Matrix in the Lecture) 
I. Once with Kernel (3 * 3) 
II. Once with Kernel (7 * 7)
